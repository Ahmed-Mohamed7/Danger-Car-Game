## Game Description


Danger Car is a entertainment 3D car game that is built on our game engine coded in C++, and OpenGL.
The idea of our game is that a car needs to reach a specific location, but it has a limited amount of health that is reduced as time passes. so, it needs to collect hearts along its way and avoid obstacles that also reduce health. 
The speed of the car is relative to its health, so having more health is always better.
On its way, the car collects bags of coins, it must collect at least half of these coins or the whole mission will be failed.
